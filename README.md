## More info to be added.
This is more or less not really a fork. This version allows for multiple databases, tables, types of data, and so much more.



## Authors Notes:
MySQL PerfectData is a simple and effecient way to save values using MySQL and allows for multiple databases and tables. The installation process is extremely straightforward, simply drag 'n' drop the repository contents and insert your database details in `lua/mysql_pdata/sv_config.lua`. Please keep in mind that this is supposed to be used as a MySQL wrapper for your scripts, you should only add this to your addons once and after that simply use the functions explained below. 

### Usage 
Tables can be stored using [util.TableToJSON](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.TableToJSON).
